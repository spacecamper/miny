Miny

A minesweeper clone.


FEATURES

 - Linux native
 - time, 3BV/s and IOE high scores, including percentiles and non-flagging 
   versions
 - scores kept indefinitely for all played games
 - recording and playing replays
 - CSV export
 - timing in milliseconds
 - responsive on slow hardware
 - adjustable square size
 - to reveal squares around a numbered square with flagged adjacent mines you
   can click the square with any button
 - no "?" marks
 - pause


TO DO

 - set window class to use with some window managers
 - prevent buffer overflows
 - estimate final statistics for a lost game, based on progress until losing


COMPILING AND PLAYING

 To compile run 'make'. You'll need to have OpenGL libraries installed, on
 Ubuntu and Debian those should be covered by the package freeglut3-dev.

 To play run './miny [options]'. For best results run from terminal.

 While playing, you can see how many effective / ineffective clicks you have
 made.

 After every game the replay is saved in the .miny subdirectory of the user's 
 home directory as 'last.replay'. Replays for won games are also saved as 
 [number].replay. See below for how to play them.


CURRENT GAME RESULTS TABLE

 After every won game there's a table showing how the current game ranks among
 all other results, and, if this game was non-flagging, among all other
 non-flagging results. That includes this game's place and percentile.

 Place is the position of this game among all other games (e.g. 213th).

 Percentile is a number between 0 and 100 saying how many percent of results 
 were worse than this game. 100 means this is the best result of all, 50 
 means this is the middle result etc. The higher this number is, the better.
 As of now this number is not exact but gives a good enough idea of how your
 game ranks.

 
MOUSE AND KEYBOARD CONTROLS

 Apart from intuitive minesweeper mouse controls, these work:

 To start a new game press Space or click the yellow square or, after a game 
 has ended, click anywhere outside the playfield.

 To pause/unpause while playing press P.

 To quit press Escape or Q.


OPTIONS

  Options with a question mark take a value.

  Game setup:

 -n?  player name. If this option is missing, system username is used.
 -d?  difficulty - 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 (1 - Beginner, 2 - Intermediate (default), 
      3 - Expert, 4 - Beginner Classic, 0 - all of the preceding four. 0 can
      be used when displaying scores) If -w, -h and -m are set, this option
      is ignored.
 -s?  square size in pixels (3 to 100, default=35)
 -m?  number of mines (min=2, max depends on field dimensions)
 -w?  field width (2 to 100)
 -h?  field height (2 to 100)


  Result display:

 -t   list best times for the selected setup
 -3   list best 3BV/s for the selected setup
 -i   list best IOEs for the selected setup
 -c   list results as CSV, e.g. for further analysis in Excel/Calc. Scores are
      listed in the order they were achieved, i.e. ordered by date. The -l 
      option is ignored in this case, all scores specified by other options
      are displayed.


  Result filter:

 -f?  select results by flagging (0 - all (default), 1 - flagging only, 
      2 - non-flagging only)
 -g?  select results by whether the game was won (0 - all, 1 - won only 
      (default), 2 - lost only) (using this option may produce buggy results)
 -l?  number of best results to display. (0 - all, default=20)


  Other:

 -p?  play replay file. Value is by default either 'last' for the last played 
      game or a number found in the Rep column of the high score table for 
      other games.
 -C?  config directory different to the default $HOME/.miny
 -o   display the currently finished game result the more brief, old way


NOTES
 
 Since version 0.5.0, the game stores scores in a new way, with more data 
 about played games. There currently isn't and probably won't be a tool to 
 convert old scores to the new system. If you don't want to keep them, you 
 can delete *.hiscore (and whichever *.replay you don't want) files from your 
 $HOME/.miny directory.


EXAMPLES

 ./miny                     # start game on intermediate difficulty

 ./miny -d3 -njoe -s40      # start game on expert difficulty, player name joe,
                            # square size 40

 ./miny -w10 -h10 -m10      # start game with the specified parameters

 ./miny -t                  # list best times for intermediate

 ./miny -d0 -3              # list best 3BV/s for beg, int, exp and beC
                              combined

 ./miny -d3 -f2 -t          # list best times for expert, non-flagging 
                            # only

 ./miny -d1 -3              # list best 3BV/s for beginner

 ./miny -w10 -h10 -m10 -t   # list best times for games with the specified 
                            # parameters

 ./miny -d2 -c > scores.csv # export intermediate scores as CSV to scores.csv

 ./miny -p last             # play replay for the last game played

 ./miny -p 4                # play the selected replay
